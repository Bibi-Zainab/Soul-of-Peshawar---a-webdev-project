    <a name="sethi"><h1>Sethi Haveli</h1></a>
    <p>Sethi Haveli, also known as Sethi House, is a beautiful example of 19th-century architecture in Sethi Mohallah, Peshawar. Built between 1835 and 1884 by the wealthy Sethi trading family, the mansion blends Mughal, Central Asian, and local architectural styles.</p>

    <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>The Sethi family, originally Hindu Khatris from Jhelum, moved to Peshawar in the early 1800s. Successful traders, they built seven havelis in the city. Their business flourished across Central Asia until the Russian Revolution of 1917 disrupted their trade routes, leading to financial decline.</p>

    <h2>Architectural Features</h2>
    <p>The mansion is made of brick, timber, and lime plaster, with intricate wooden carvings, stained glass windows, and elaborate frescoes. Key features include tehkhanas (underground basements), dalaans (large halls), balakhanas (upper floors), a central courtyard with a marble fountain, and decorative chinikhanas (small display niches).</p>

    <h2>Design & Layout</h2>
    <p>Inspired by Bukhara’s vernacular architecture, the haveli includes 12 rooms, four basements, colourful glass ceilings, carved wooden doors, and ventilated atriums. Highlights include the Takht-e-Sulaimani — a wooden resting spot for sunbathing in winter — and mirror-adorned ceilings.</p>
    
    <h2>Visiting Information</h2>
    <p>Located near Ghanta Ghar and Qissa Khwani Bazaar, Sethi House is open daily from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Guided tours are available, offering insights into the region’s cultural and architectural history.</p>

        <h1>Sethi Mohallah</h1>
        <p>Sethi Mohallah is a historic neighbourhood famed for its havelis built by the influential Sethi family. The homes reflect a mix of Central Asian, Persian, and South Asian designs, with wooden carvings, frescoes, and airy courtyards. Tekhanas were cleverly designed to keep homes cool during Peshawar’s hot summers.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Legacy</h2>
        <p>The Sethis were respected traders and philanthropists in Peshawar, contributing to public projects like wells and mosques. The most famous mansion — Sethi House — was converted into a museum in 2010, preserving its rich architectural heritage for future generations.</p>
