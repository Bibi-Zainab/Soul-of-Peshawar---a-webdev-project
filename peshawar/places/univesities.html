  </div>

  <h2>Cash Donations by Nawabs</h2>
  <p>On June 2, 1911, a delegation headed by Sahibzaba Abdul Qayyum Khan visited Tangi Charsadda and set up his camp at the Hujra of Khan Bahadur Ghulam Haider Khan of Tangi for collection of donations. Khans of Tangi donated a handsome amount of Rs.25000 and the delegation stayed for 3 days at Tangi and them moved Umarzai village when donation of Rs.12000 was collected and then to Turangzai where Rs.20000 and from Rajar Rs.3000 and finally to village Charsadda. I total Rs 150,000 was collected from Hashtnagar. Subsequently, a large plot of land was purchased for the college building from the Khalil (Arbabs) of Tehkal and Sufaid Dheri Rs. 150,000/- from Nizam of Hyderabad and the construction cost building Paid by Nawab of Amb Rs 100,000/- was sent by the prime minister of Amb Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah to Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum as donation for the college.</p>

  <h2>Conception</h2>
  <p>When the new province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (previously known as N.W.F.P) was formed in 1901 after its separation from the Punjab, there was only one college (Edwardes College) in whole province. This scarcity of quality educational institutions forced local youth to travel to faraway regions of the country (British India) in pursuit of higher education. This same lack of educational opportunities in the region motivated Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum and Sir George Roos-Keppel to establish an institution that would not only cater to the academic needs of the region but also produce leaders from the region.</p>

  <h2>Foundation</h2>
  <p>In 1909, Nawab Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum and Sir George Roos-Keppel envisioned a college in Peshawar after visiting Aligarh Muslim University. On April 12, 1911, a meeting was held where donations were collected, and land was purchased for the college. Funds were contributed by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Nawab of Amb, and other local leaders.</p>

  <p>Haji Sahib of Turangzai, a prominent anti-British religious leader, was invited to lay the foundation stone. Despite being banned from British territory, he was granted temporary permission. He hid his face during the ceremony, laid the stone, and left immediately afterward. Islamia College was thus established with support from both British officials and local leaders</p>

  <h2>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's will</h2>
  <p>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah visited this College in 1936, 1945 and 1948. Quaid-e-Azam, who became lifelong honorary member of the Khyber Union ICP in 1936, made the college one of the heirs of his property in 1939:
  <p><em>"All my residuary estate including the corpus that may fall after the lapse of life interest or otherwise to be divided into three parts - and I bequeath one part to Aligarh University - one part to Islamia College Peshawar and one part to Sindh Madrassa of Karachi..."</em>- Quaid-e-Azam's Will, Bombay, May 30, 1939

  Addressing the students of the college on April 12, 1948, he said: “Let me tell you that nothing is nearer to my heart than to have a great center of culture and learning in a place like Peshawar, a place from where the rays of knowledge and culture can spread throughout the Middle East and Central Asia.”</p>

The college, affiliated with the University of Peshawar, has about 3,000 students in Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Business Administration, Higher National Diploma, and Computer Sciences.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Originally a co-educational college, it became a boys-only college in 1930s. Edwardes has become co-educational again since 2000 with about 200 female students and 15 women among its faculty members, with numbers of women anticipated to increase. The college has a vital community life, which includes freedom of worship for all faiths, sporting events, a debating society, drama productions, and student publications. Up to 1974 it was running up by as organisation affiliated with the Church Mission Society however following Nationalisation Reforms of 1974 it was handed over to the Board of Governors headed by NWFP Governor. A ruling of the Peshawar High Court dated 14 November 2019 dismissed the plea of the Principal challenging the nationalisation of the college.[1]</p>
  
  <p>The Church Missionary Society established the Church Mission College in 1900 as an outgrowth of Edwardes High School, which had been founded in 1855 by the society as the first institution of western-style schooling in the northwest frontier region of what was British India. For many years the college was the only institution of higher education in the northwest frontier. Sir Herbert Edwardes was a British colonial administrator and commander whose name the college later adopted.</p>
  
  <p>The first major college building, now known as the Old Hall, was built in 1910 in a Moghul style that was replicated in a number of the college's later buildings. Edwardes College was visited three times by the founder of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, by Mahatma Gandhi, and the previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In its early years Edwardes awarded degrees through the University of Punjab; since 1952 its degrees have been awarded through the University of Peshawar.</p>
