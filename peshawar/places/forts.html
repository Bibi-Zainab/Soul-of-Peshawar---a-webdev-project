    <h1 name="jamrudfort">Jamrud Fort</h1>
    
    <p>Standing in Peshawar, where the dusty plains meet the rugged mountains, <strong>Jamrud Fort</strong> has been the city’s first line of defense for centuries. This formidable fortress guards the <strong>eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass</strong> —the legendary gateway that has shaped Peshawar’s destiny as a city of warriors, traders, and empires.</p>

    <h2>Peshawar’s Guardian Fort</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The City’s Last Stand</strong>: For Peshawar—historically known as the "<strong>City of the Frontier</strong>"—Jamrud Fort was more than just a military outpost. It was the final barrier between invading armies and the bustling bazaars of Peshawar. Whoever controlled Jamrud held the key to the city.</li>
            
        <li> <strong>Sikh Empire’s Stronghold</strong>: When the legendary Sikh general <strong>Hari Singh Nalwa</strong> built Jamrud Fort in 1836, he secured Peshawar as the westernmost frontier of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s empire. The fort became a <strong>launching point for Sikh campaigns</strong> into tribal territories, ensuring Peshawar remained under Sikh rule.</li>
                
        <li><strong>British Frontier Defense</strong>: After the fall of the Sikh Empire, the British recognized Jamrud’s strategic importance. They reinforced it as a <strong>critical checkpoint</strong> to control the Khyber Pass and protect Peshawar—their most important garrison city in the Northwest Frontier.</ul></p></li>
          
        <h2>Why Visit Jamrud Fort Today?</h2>

        <h1 name="babekhyber">Bab-e-Khyber</h1>

        <p><strong><em><q>He who holds the Khyber, holds the key to the subcontinent." — Ancient Proverb</q></em></strong></p>
              
        <p>Standing proudly at the entrance of the <strong>mighty Khyber Pass, Bab-e-Khyber</strong> is more than just an arch—it’s a <strong>symbol of Pakistan’s rugged frontier spirit</strong>. Built in 1964, this monumental gate marks the beginning of one of the world’s most famous mountain passes, a <strong>historic corridor that has shaped empires, wars, and trade for over 2,000 years</strong>.</p>
            
        <h2>Why Bab-e-Khyber Matters</h2>
        <p><strong>Peshawar’s Pride</strong>: Just a short drive from the city, the arch connects Peshawar—Pakistan’s oldest living city—to the wild tribal frontiers and beyond. It represents the <strong>cultural and historical bridge</strong> between the settled areas and the legendary Pashtun heartland.</p>
            
        <strong>Gateway to Empires</strong>: The Khyber Pass has been the invasion highway for conquerors like <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>, <strong>Mughal emperors</strong>, and <strong>British forces</strong>. Bab-e-Khyber stands as a modern monument to this ancient legacy.
            
        <strong>Passage Through Time</strong>: From <strong>Silk Road caravans</strong> to <strong>Soviet tanks retreating from Afghanistan</strong>, the Khyber Pass has seen it all—and Bab-e-Khyber is its <strong>grand welcome sign</strong>.

        <h2>What Makes It a Must-Visit?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Stunning Architecture: The arch’s bold Islamic design and towering structure make it a perfect photo spot, especially against the backdrop of the Khyber’s rugged mountains.</li>
            <li>✔ Historical Significance: Standing here, you’re at the same crossroads where empires clashed, traders bartered, and adventurers embarked into the unknown.</li>
           <li>✔ Scenic Drive: Beyond the arch, the Khyber Pass road twists through breathtaking landscapes, dotted with ancient forts, tribal villages, and panoramic views.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <p>Bab-e-Khyber isn’t just a landmark—it’s where Pakistan’s history begins and adventure unfolds.</p>
