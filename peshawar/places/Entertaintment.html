    <p><b>Wazir Bagh</b> (Pashto, Urdu: وزير باغ) is an 18th-century garden in Peshawar, Pakistan.</p>
        
    <h2>Overview & History</h2>
    <p>Wazir Bagh was built in 1810 by <b>Sardar Fateh Mohammad Khan Barkzai</b>, known as ,<b>Wazir</b>, during the <b>rule of Prince Shah Mahmood Durrani</b>. The garden once featured lush fruit trees like apricots, peaches, and pomegranates, along with vibrant flowers. <b>English envoy Sir Alexander Burnes visited in 1832.</b> However, due to urban growth and lack of awareness, the garden’s condition has deteriorated, and it’s now mostly used for recreational activities like tennis ball cricket, with some refurbishment underway since 2020 under the Peshawar revival plan.</p>
        
    <h2>🏛️ Architecture and Layout</h2>
    <p><b>Designed in the Mughal and Persian tradition</b>, Wazir Bagh follows the charbagh (four-part garden) layout, symbolizing the four rivers of paradise. The garden once featured a grand baradari (pavilion), fountains, and shaded trees, creating a peaceful retreat. Though many features have faded, the original design still reflects a harmonious blend of nature and architecture.</p>
