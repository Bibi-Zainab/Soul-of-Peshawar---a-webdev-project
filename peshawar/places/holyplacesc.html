    <p><strong>Masjid Muhabbat Khan</strong> (Hindko and Urdu:مہابت خان مسجد))(Pashto: مهابت خان جومات), sometimes spelled Mohabbat Khan Mosque, is a 17th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" title="Mughal Empire" target="_blank">Mughal</a>-era mosque located in the historic city of Peshawar, Pakistan. The mosque was constructed in 1630 and named after the Mughal governor of Peshawar, Mahabat Khān.</p>
    <p>The mosque's stunning white marble façade and intricate architectural details are considered some of Peshawar’s most iconic landmarks.</p>
 
    <h2>Overview of History</h2>
    <p>The mosque was built between 1660 and 1670 by the Mughals on what was the highest point in the old walled city of Peshawar, offering a commanding view of the area.</p>
    <p>During Sikh rule, the mosque’s minarets were unfortunately misused for public executions. Five people per day were hanged for calling the Azan (Islamic call to prayer) after it was banned, using the mosque's minarets as a substitute for gallows.</p>
    <p>After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War" title="Soviet–Afghan War" target="_blank">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>, the mosque became a meeting place for Afghan tribal elders and leaders, who gathered to build unity and resistance against foreign occupation.</p>

    <h2>Architectural Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The mosque features a large courtyard surrounded by colonnades with rows of rooms for worshippers.</li>
        <li>Its white marble prayer hall is richly decorated with floral motifs and Quranic calligraphy.</li>
        <li>The mosque has two elegant minarets that are a significant feature of Peshawar’s skyline.</li>
        <li>The façade includes beautifully engraved arches and niches, reflecting traditional Mughal craftsmanship.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Cultural and Religious Importance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Masjid Muhabbat Khan is one of the few remaining examples of Mughal architecture in Peshawar.</li>
        <li>It continues to serve as an important place of worship and a gathering space for community meetings and religious events.</li>
        <li>The mosque is particularly crowded during Ramadan, Eid prayers, and special Islamic occasions.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="joshiwara(gurdwara)"><h1>Gurdwara Bhai Joshi Singh (Joshiwara)</h1></a>

    <p><b>Joshiwara is a Sikh Gurdwara</b>, a place of worship and community center, and is located in Peshawar,Pakistan.</p>
    <p><b>Gurdwara Bhai Joga Singh</b> is situated in Jogan Shah area of Namakmandi of Peshawar City. The Gurdwara, which was founded by <b>Hari Singh Nalwa</b> (<b>Maharaja Ranjit Singh</b>'s fabled General) when Peshawar was part of the Sikh Kingdom. It is named in honour of <b>Bhai Joga Singh</b>, a young Gursikh who had lived in the presence of <b>Guru Gobind Singh</b> at Anandpur for many years.</p>

    <p>One day his parents, eager to see him married, arrived at Anandpur to escort him back to Peshawar. The Guru permitted him to depart, saying that he must return at once when recalled. Back in Peshawar Joga Singh was in the midst of his nuptials and had completed only two of the customary four circumambulations when a Sikh arrived and delivered the Guru's letter of recall. As the Guru had used the words, '<em>at once</em>' , he left the ceremony midway, despite the many and loud protestations of his relatives, immediately setting out for <b>Anandpur</b>.</p>

    
    <h2>Overview of History </h2>
    <p>After the Partition of India in 1947, most of the Sikh community in Peshawar migrated to India. The gurdwara was subsequently closed and remained unused for nearly 60 years. During this time, it came under the 
    custody of the Auqaf Department, which protected the structure from encroachment but did little to preserve or maintain it.</p>
